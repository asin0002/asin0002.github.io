        My name is Atungdiwe Asinah , i am 17 years old and i am from ghana i
        came to canada back in april and after spending 1 semester in computer
        programming i realied it is not for me and i transfered<br />
        back home in ghana i did html and css in a softwere eingeering class so
        i can say i have some good and decent amound of expierence in web
        development. i used to create website for NGOs.<br />
        i plan to finish the IMD program and either become a UX designer or Do
        something with Information Resource managment or maybe become a
        developer i am not completely sure but i do know by the end of of this
        program i would know.

      <p>
        Apart from my studies i like animals especially dogs and i have 6 dogs
        back home and the 6<sup>th</sup> is named after my grandmother. i think
        the one thing i love most is football you guys call it soccer over
        here,and my favourite team is liverpool football club .<br />
        i live and breathe football and some people think i love it too much
        that it gets in the way of my social life. I also happen to be very
        knowledgable when it comes to general knowledge and i like watching
        videos on philosophy and<em> christain history and theology</em>. I
        Belive everyday im trying to live according tomy Faith as a christain
        and Grow into the person God wants me to be and Bring people closer
        God.<br />
        Lastly i like Anime i dont really watch it alot nowadays but my
        favorites are: One piece, Bleach, Naruto,Vinland Saga and Attack on
        Titan. and i think JJK is overrated.
